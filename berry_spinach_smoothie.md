# Berry & Spinach smoothie

## Ingredients
* 2 cups unsweetened frozen berries (raspberry/blackberry/blueberry mix etc)
* 1 cup milk (Lactose-free Skim/2% or oat milk)
* 4 Mejdool dates, pitted
* 1 banana
* 1 orange (Cara Cara orange preferred)
* 2 cups vanilla greek yogurt (Skim/0% milkfat variety w/ lowest sugar content)
* 1 tbsp ground flax meal
* 1 giant handful fresh spinach leaves, washed

## Steps
1. Put everything except spinach into blender. Frozen berries and milk on the bottom first mixes best.
2. Blend until smooth.
3. Add spinach and blend until the pieces look small enough.

## Notes
* You don't absorb nutrients very well from whole flax seeds, so go for flax meal. You can find this in the bulk aisle at the story.
* It takes awhile to blend up the fruit, so do that before the spinach is added. You want to minimize the amount of blending you do for the spinach or your smoothie color will be brown
* Makes enough for 2 pint glasses. I have one immediately and put the other in a pint glass in the fridge w/ saran wrap over the top for the next day.
* After it sits overnight, the color may be a little brown but it still tastes the same.
