# Berry & Spinach smoothie

## Ingredients
* 1 cup milk (Lactose-free Skim/2% or oat milk)
* 1 banana
* 1 orange (Cara Cara orange preferred b/c it has lower acid)
* 3 Mejdool dates, pitted
* 1 TBSP ground flaxmeal
* 2 cups unsweetened frozen berries (raspberry/blackberry/blueberry mix etc)
* 1 cup greek yogurt (Skim/0% milkfat variety w/ lowest sugar content, vanilla flavor is good too)
* 1 giant handful fresh spinach leaves, washed

## Steps
1. Put milk, banana, orange, dates, and flaxmeal into blender. Blend until smooth.
2. Add greek yogurt and frozen berries. Blend until smooth.
3. Add spinach and blend until the pieces look small enough.

## Notes
* You don't absorb nutrients very well from whole flax seeds, so go for flax meal. You can find this in the bulk aisle at the story.
* Add the frozen fruit after you have most of the other things blended or your blender can gum up (if it's a cheap one like mine).
* Blend the spinach last just enough to break down. If you add it at the beginning, you'll way overblend it and the whole smoothie will look red+green=brown.
* Makes enough for 2 pint glasses. I have one immediately and put the other in a pint glass in the fridge w/ saran wrap pressed down onto the surface and over the top to block the air (top gets brown, but still tastes the same).
