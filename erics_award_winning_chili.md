## Ingredients
### Vegetable prep
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 lg white onion, finely chopped
- 1 lg red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed (4 cloves whole used in later step as well)

### Meat
- 1 lb beef stew chunks
- 1 lb ground beef (lean 90/10 preferable)

### Beans & tomatoes
- 2, 15oz cans chili beans in sauce, low sodium
- 1, 15oz cans petite-diced tomatores, drained

### Blended paste
- 1, 7oz can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 4 cloves garlic, whole
- 3 Fresno chili peppers, de-seeded

### Seasoning
- 1-3 packets off-the-shelf medium chili seasoning packets (number of packets sized based on lbs of meat/beans on the back of the recipe)
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1-2 tbsp Blue Mountain Country Jamaican Curry powder
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tbsp dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp Hungarian sweet paprika
- 1 packet Sazon Goya
- 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce

### For serving
- Oyster crackers
- Sour cream
- Shredded cheese
- Green onions

## Steps
1. In dutch oven or big pot, sautee onion with butter
2. Add bell pepper and cook until softened up a bit
3. Add the 4 cloves crushed garlic and cook until fragrant, but not browned
4. Take big pot off the heat for now
5. In a ripping-hot skillet/frying pan, sear beef stew chunks
   * Work in batches to not overcrowd the pan
   * Not trying to cook through, just get outer browning on one or two sides
   * Put browned chunks into big pot with vegetables
6. Brown ground beef in skillet/frying pan over medium heat
   * Put browned meat into big pot
7. Add chili beans, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dijon, worcestershire and mix
8. Put big pot back on medium-low heat
9. Mix in dried spices
   * Start with half of OTS chili seasoning packets
   * OTS chili seasoning packets probably include salt and all are a bit different, so you need to taste as you go
10. Blend up chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, 4 whole cloves garlic, and 3 Fresno chili peppers
    * Add a spoonful at a time to chili throughout cooking
    * Taste for heat level as you go
11. Simmer for 60-90 minutes, stirring periodically, leave the lid on
12. Serve with oyster crackers, sour cream, shredded cheese, and green onions as toppings

## Notes
- Cooking the meat separately lets you get browned flavor and control cooking so it's not already fully cooked going into the pot.  
- Ground beef + beef chunks makes for better mix of flavor and texture
- Canned beans are already cooked, and don't need to stew all day. No noticeable taste difference from soaking dried beans.
- Fish out bay leaves at the end
- At the start of the simmering period, the chili will look almost too dry or thick, but moisture releases during cooking and consistency gets more sauce-like
- My butcher has the pre-cut 3/4" beef stew chunks in their case, so I don't have to cube it myself.
- You will probably not need to use all of the blender mix or the OTS seasoning packets. Blender mix is like Super Sambal Oelek and is great on eggs.
- Use low-sodium chili beans in sauce, or your salt level at the end might be too much.
