# Healthy raspberry and spinach smoothie

## Ingredients
* 2 cups unsweetened frozen raspberries
* 2 cups vanilla greek yogurt (Oikos Triple-Zero!)
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
* 4 Mejdool dates, pitted
* 1 banana
* 1 orange
* 1 tbsp flax meal
* 1 big handful fresh spinach leaves

## Steps
1. Put everything except spinach into blender.
2. Blend until smooth.
3. Add spinach and blend until the pieces look small enough.

## Notes
* You don't absorb nutrients very well from whole flax seeds, so go for flax meal. You can find this in the bulk aisle at the story.
* It takes awhile to blend up the fruit, so do that before the spinach is added. You want to minimize the amount of blending you do for the spinach or your smoothie color will be brown
* Makes 2 servings. I have one immediately and put the other in a pint glass in the fridge w/ a sandwich baggie over the top for the next day.
* After it sits overnight, the color may be a little brown but it still tastes the same.
* If you have bananas that are getting a bit brown, you can put them in the freezer to save them and put the whole frozen banana (peeled, duh) into the blender for the smoothie.
