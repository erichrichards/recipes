# Granny's Corn Casserole

## Ingredients
* 1 box Jiffy cornbread mix
* 1 egg
* 1 big heaping tablespoon sour cream
* 2-3 tbsp melted butter
* 1 can creamed corn
* 1 can kernel corn, drained
* Salt, pepper, sweet paprika

## Steps
1. Mix everything in a separate bowl than you bake in.
2. Salt & pepper. Lots of pepper, less salt if using salted butter. Paprika for some flavor, but not enough to tint the mix.
3. Pour mix into pre-sprayed baking dish
4. Bake at temperature on Jiffy box instructions (covered)
5. When it doesn't jiggle much in the dish, uncover and bake to brown the top some

## Notes
* If you use cooking spray in the baking dish and then pour in the mixture, it makes cleanup way easier. If you mix in the dish that you sprayed, the spray just gets incorporated into the mix instead of being ON the dish surface.
* Original recipe had a stick of butter and a cup of sour cream, which is insane. Guestimate the sour cream and butter addition so the mix is pale yellow. You get plenty of moisture from the other ingredients.
* Usually make 2 or 3 batches at once. 2 can fit in your square corningware, 3 can fit in your dutch oven.
